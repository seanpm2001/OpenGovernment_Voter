##### What is a free and fair election

10 dimensions of free and fair electoral conduct

1. legal framework (whether there was a constitutional right of citizens to vote and seek office, whether elections were held at regular intervals, and whether election-related laws were not changed immediately before an election)
2. electoral management (whether gerrymandering occurred and whether election management bodies, if they existed, were independent, impartial, and accountable);
3. electoral rights (whether citizens were generally able to vote on the basis of equal suffrage and access);
4. voter registers (whether they were accurate, current, and open to voters for easy and effective voter registration);
5. ballot access (whether candidates had in practice a right to compete in the election, with rejections of candidate applications being based on "internationally recognizable and acceptable norms" and with no candidate receiving more than 75% of the votes (an signal of malpractice or election boycotts);
6. campaign process (whether elections were carried out without violence, intimidation, bribery (vote buying), use of government resources to advantage the incumbent, or a "massive financial advantages" for the incumbent;
7. media access (whether freedom of speech was protected and whether the ruling party was disproportionately benefited by government-owned media;
8. voting process (whether elections were conducted by secret ballot on a one person, one vote basis, with adequate security to protect voters and protection against ballot box stuffing, multiple voting, destruction of valid ballots, and other forms of manipulation;
9. role of officials (whether the election was administered with adequately trained personnel, free from campaigning or intimidation at polling places, and with the ability of international election observers and party representatives to observe polling places; and
10. counting of votes (whether votes were tabulated transparently and free of fraud or tampering)
